- Prompts for harvesting and depositing resources
- Dynamic message feedback and floating UI elements

---

Tech Stack

- HTML5 Canvas
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Object-Oriented Design
- CSS (minimal styling)

---

In Progress / TODO

- Refactor and modularize code (split into multiple files)
- Improve NPC movement (less RNG, more logic)
- Polish UI and visual feedback
- Integrate persistent storage (SQLite or server later)
- Add sprite/asset support

Notes

This is an active solo project to explore:
- Canvas rendering performance
- Game loop architecture
- Object-oriented JavaScript for frontend devs

I’m intentionally building from scratch with minimal dependencies to better understand how to build something from the ground up. 
I’m also new to Git and version control in general, so this project is helping me practice not just JavaScript, but also how to structure commits, organize a repo, and work like a real developer.
It’s still a work-in-progress, but I’m learning a lot with each iteration. I figure starting with one project and sticking with it might be beneficial.
